# Alarm Clock for iOS
This is a simple alarm clock for iOS I did as a sample project to do some iOS and F# programming using the Xamarin tools.

Some of the functionality:
* Animated clock
* Astronomy pictures of the day as background
* A news ticker at the bottom
* Plays streaming internet radio 
* Shows some weather information
* Sleep timer

## Disclaimer
This is meant to be an example application for me to play around with some technologies and in order for it to be generally useful quite a few things are still missing like for example a snooze function, programmable alarm times for different days of the weeks, additional configuration options, like e.g. setting your own radio stations, better handling of alarms if application is in the background etc. etc.
