# Alarm Clock for iOS
This is a simple alarm clock for iOS I did as a sample project to do some iOS and F# programming using the Xamarin tools.

Some of the functionality:
* Animated clock
* Astronomy pictures of the day as background
* RSS news feed ticker
* Plays streaming internet radio
* Shows radio station meta data (artist, song title etc)
* Localized weather information
* Sleep timer which will fade out radio (and dim screen)
* Alarm timer which will fade in radio (and brighten up screen)
* Night/day mode for adjusting brightness of screen

## Improvements
This is an example application to play around with some technologies and in order for it to be generally useful quite a few things are still missing like for example a snooze function, programmable alarm times for different days of the weeks, additional configuration options, like e.g. setting your own radio stations, better handling of alarms if application is in the background etc. etc. It works, but don't blame me if you miss an important appointment because of it ;)
